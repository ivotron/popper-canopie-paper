@inproceedings{david:precs19,
 abstract = {Computer network research experiments can be broadly grouped in three categories: simulated, controlled, and real-world experiments. Simulation frameworks, experiment testbeds and measurement tools, respectively, are commonly used as the platforms for carrying out network experiments. In many cases, given the nature of computer network experiments, properly configuring these platforms is a complex and time-consuming task, which makes replicating and validating research results quite challenging. This complexity can be reduced by leveraging tools that enable experiment reproducibility. In this paper, we show how a recently proposed reproducibility tool called Popper facilitates the reproduction of networking exper- iments. In particular, we detail the steps taken to reproduce results in two published articles that rely on simulations. The outcome of this exercise is a generic workflow for carrying out network simulation experiments. In addition, we briefly present two additional Popper workflows for running experiments on controlled testbeds, as well as studies that gather real-world metrics (all code is publicly available on Github). We close by providing a list of lessons we learned throughout this process.},

 abstract = {Independent validation of experimental results in the field of parallel and distributed systems research is a challenging task, mainly due to changes and differences in software and hardware in computational environments. Recreating an environment that resembles the original systems research is difficult and time-consuming. In this paper we introduce the Popper Convention, a set of principles for producing scientific publications. Concretely, we make the case for treating an article as an open source software (OSS) project, applying software engineering best-practices to manage its associated artifacts and maintain the reproducibility of its findings. Leveraging existing cloud-computing infrastructure and modern OSS development tools to produce academic articles that are easy to validate. We present our prototype file system, GassyFS, as a use case for illustrating the usefulness of this approach. We show how, by following Popper, re-executing experiments on multiple platforms is more practical, allowing reviewers and students to quickly get to the point of getting results without relying on the author's intervention.},
